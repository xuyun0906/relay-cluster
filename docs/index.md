# Loopring Relay Cluster


Loopring Relay is an important part of Loopring’s technology and ecosystem. It centralizes the management of offline order pools, broadcasts and matches Loopring’s orders at the same time, and provides complete back-end services for exchanges and wallets. Based on the centralized system, we use the order broadcasting system to share orders to multiple relays to implement a network-wide order pool. This document describes the three parts of Loopring’s relay, being; how the relay functions, how third-party partners can access the relay, and how the relay deploys orders to the miners.

## Glossary

| Type | Name | Explanation | 
|------|------|------|
| Order | Order | Order data that conforms to the Loopring protocol format |
| Order | OrderHash | The signature of the order, that is, the summary generated after the execution of the hash algorithm by the order part field |
| Order | Owner | The order owner, originating from the user wallet address |
| Order | OrderType | There are two order types supported by the Relay: 1. market_order (Market Order) is an order shared by the entire exchange order pool, and can be finalized by anybody. 2. P2p_order (point-to-point order) does not contain wallet private key authentication orders, but they can only be authorized to share the private keys that users can match up. |
| Order | WalletAddress | The wallet sub-address that completes the order, which is usually the address of the exchange’s Research and Development team. It is used to distribute the shares of profits after the order is completed. The current model is to allocate 20% of the profits back to the wallet of the original purchaser, and 80% to the miner’s wallet. |
| Order | AuthAddr & AuthPrivateKey | At the time of submitting the order, it is a random successful public and private key pair. AuthAddr is used to sign the order, and AuthPrivateKey is used to participate in submitting the signature of the ring when the match is made. The purpose is to prevent the order or loop from being tampered with. In the case of a point-to-point order, AuthPrivateKey is shared with a specific user through a two-dimensional code. This protects the order from being taken by more than one user. |
| Order | TokenS | Token for sale, please refer to the list of supported tokens |
| Order | TokenB | Token to buy, please refer to the list of supported tokens |
| Order | AmountS | The number of tokens to sell |
| Order | AmountB | The number of tokens to buy |
| Order | ValidSince | The effective time of the order, indicated by the timestamp on the order. If the current time is less than ValidSince, the order is not in effect. |
| Order | ValidUntil | The expiration time of the order indicated by the timestamp on the order. If the time is greater than ValidUntil, the order will become invalid |
| Order | LrcFee | Set LRC Fee for this order |
| Order | buyNoMoreThanAmountB | Determines whether to allow the purchase of amountB of tokenB based on an excess amount. Say the current market price (LRC-WETH) is .0001, and the user sets an order to buy 100 at .0002 (requiring 0.2 WETH), if buyNoMoreThanAmountB = true, then the end user will buy 100 LRC at a price of .0001 (regardless of their intended gain) |
| Order | marginSplitPercentage | The percentage used to pay for the completion and mining of the order, usually defaulting to 50% |
| Order | v, r, s | To get the result of order signing, first you must generate OrderHash using the Keccak256 algorithm for part of the order, then do an ECDSA signature for a Hash and generate the result. |
| Order | powNonce | We use proof of work when submitting an order, which limits excessive order submissions to prevent the order subsystem from being spammed. powNonce uses the workload proof algorithm calculation to verify if the nonce passes the proof of work, then the order is verified and submitted to the Relay. |
| Order | Coupling | This checks that two or more orders satisfy the condition of forming a Loopring loop, if the ring turnover is a match of Loopring’s, then a ring transaction can be formed. |
| Order | Ring | Differing from the traditional exchange order, Loopring’s approach forms a ring-shaped order that can allow a transfer between multiple coins and parties.The ring is formed when an order is started. |
| Order | Partial cancellation | In the Loopr2 version of the wallet, the user cancels the order and it is submitted to the smart contract. This costs fuel and can not be immediately cancelled. Because of this, we have added a partial cancellation function to the relay. When partial cancellation requirements have been met, (for example, the order has not settled yet or is not in the process of being settled) the order can be cancelled off-chain through the relay immediately and without any fuel costs. |
| Account | Allowance | This is token authorization, which usually refers to an authorized user of Loopring Protocol, that wants to use Loopring to match user orders. This user can only use the smart contract for the authorized operation, and the Loopring smart contract can then settle the user’s order. |
| Account | Balance | The balance of the user's assets contains the ETH balance and all ERC20 Token balances. |
| Account | WETH | WETH is an ERC20 Token anchored by Ethereum on ETH that  can always exchange equal amounts of ETH without any extra charge (except for the transaction cost). Loopring only supports the exchange of assets between ERC20 tokens, but does not support the exchange of ETH and ERC20, so before a user exchanges, their coins must be changed from ETH to WETH, which simultaneously authorizes the Loopring smart contract to use WETH. |
| Market | Fill | The information and data for the transaction, sent out after the event of the smart contract settling the transaction. |
| Market | Depth | The depth of the market |
| Market | Ticker | 24-hour statistics on the changing of the market |
| Market | Trend | Market trend information, which is currently set at a one hour period |
| Market | RingMined | The result of the order being filled and settled |
| Market | Cutoff | The user sets a time that they want the order to be completed by, and if it is not completed in time, the order becomes invalid |
| Market | PriceQuote | Market value reference for each currency, currently supporting BTC, CNY, USD|
| Contract | LoopringProtocolImpl | The address required to enter the Loopring smart contract,  if it is needed, the address will change |
| Contract | DelegateAddress | The delegated contract address, with the order pool being divided up based on the delegate contract. Orders of different delegate addresses cannot be put together. |
| General | Token | Ethereum Token, currently the only supported Tokens are ones that fully comply with the ERC20 standard |
| General | Transaction | This is referring to the Ethereum trading operations such as user transfer/authorization/contract invocation. In the relay, we package order transactions together by the type of user, utilising Ethereum user identification methods. |
| General | Gas | When submitting an Ethereum transaction, you need to specify the GasPrice and GasLimit to pay for the transaction costs. Loopring supports obtaining the best possible network price. |
| General | Nonce | This is an incrementing integer starting from 1 that is equal to the current value of the total number of transactions submitted by the user. The nonce is needed for verification when a user is submitting a transaction, and each nonce can only have one transaction submitted for it. Since the Relay has access to a large number of Loopring wallets across multiple versions (web/ios/android), with multiple parties using them at the same time, using the centralized maintenance of nonce functionality will maximize transaction success.  |
| General | Miner | Loopring’s ring miners identify order rings and submit them to the smart contract |
| General | Decimal | Assuring ERC20 Token Unit accuracy. Generally, the number of Tokens in an order divided by the Decimal is the actual number, usually the Decimal=1e18. |
| General | Symbol | Shorter version of the ERC20 Token name. For example, Loopring ERC20 Token is LRC. |

## How the Relay Works

### Loopring Ecosystem

Loopring protocol currently based on the Ethereum smart contract has a chain order pool that is individually maintained by one relay, working together to achieve a total network pool integration with higher liquidity. We broadcast each order and connect all the relays to achieve an entire network of exchange orders. The Relay can use the order broadcast hub to exchange orders with other relays. At the same time the Loopring Miner can commit to multiple Relay orders. The order broadcast hub connects all the relays and the miner to form a larger (relative to a single relay) order pool.

___

### System Structure

The relay is a layered architecture system common in a centralized exchange, like a wallet, that runs in the background:
* System access layer, which is an external interface layer providing wallet and exchange services, supporting jsonrpc 2.0 and socketio
* Business logic layer, including various business logic interfaces and specific implementation
* Storage layer, including caching and constant storage, cache access to Redis. We chose a kv storage system (Redis) and a relational storage system (Mysql) to save and maximize storage. Redis is used to store data suitable for kv queries and queries that have higher performance requirements. One example of this could be the user’s account balance. MySQL is used to store relatively complex data queries such as the user's order and transaction information.
* Broadcast layer, used to spread out orders

___

### Wallet Background Services

Wallet background is used to support wallet-related services, including user account balance, authorizations, transaction data, wallet nonce, and cutoff information.

___

### Exchange Background Services

Exchange background services are used to support exchange-related functions, including: exchange order pools, order information, loop information, market trend charts/k-line data, in-depth/orderbook data, and global/third-party market exchange prices.

___

### Basic Services
Provides some basic configuration information for relays and Ethereum, such as Ethereum's estimated gasPrice, relay-supported contract list, relay-supported token list, and market-pair list.

___

### Ethereum Analysis Services

Ethereum analysis services are used to identify data on the chain and transfer it to the relay. This includes analyzing raw data such as blocks, transactions, and events, forming service categories, transferring to relays, and then completing transactions or events. It also updates user balances, orders, and transaction information. Lastly, resolution services deal with the frequent occurrence of Ethereum bifurcation.

___

### Mining And Relaying Services

According to the Loopring protocol white paper, Loopring orders are linked together on the chain, through the chained liquidation system, the miner discovers the loop in the chain, and the miner clears the chain, submitting the discovered loop to the Loopring smart contract. The liquidation is completed and the token received from the transaction is sent to the user and the sub-run address. The relaying service discovers loops and submits smart contracts.

___

## Features

### Order Management

This manages order life cycles, handles operations of user and Ethereum order updates, and provides different types of query interfaces for users and other subsystems.

#### Submitting an Order
The submit order interface handles orders from users and transmissions to other relay sources.

#### Checking
Before an order can be successfully processed, it needs to go through the following series of checks:
```
1. Workload verification check (Workload verification check detailed below)
2. Basic verification rules, including the minimum amount of amountS and the minimum amount of legal currency; the latest effective time limit (not later than a certain point of time, the current setting can’t be later than the order submission time of 10 hours); the proportion of sub-runs must be between 0 and 1; Validity check of account address and Token address, etc.
3. Verify the signature, and obtain the signed address based on v, r, s and wallet address
4. Is it supported by the token and the market
5. Whether the order has expired
```

#### Completed Order Information
After a series of verification checks, the orderHash, price, market and other fields of the order will be filled to facilitate the follow-up relational query.

#### Transmission Broadcast Policy
The last order will be transmitted to the database. If the relay sets a broadcast policy, the order will be broadcasted according to the policy. At this point, the order submission process ends.

#### Order Tracking

We provide a multi-dimensional query interface for orders, in addition to the most basic order list query (see API documentation), we also provide an order-based market depth query interface, and an orderbook query interface (market depth is the result of similar-price aggregation, and the Orderbook does not aggregate orders).

---

### Account Management

This is the user's Ethereum wallet address account, we support a series of write operations for the wallet address: transfer/authorization/WETH conversion, etc., transmit the user account balance to the in-memory database, and update the user account balance in real-time. The Relay centrally maintains the user's latest nonce and ensures the highest accuracy, while the nonce provided by the Relay can minimize the failure rate of the user's Ethereum activity. Account management also maintains all transaction records of the user to help the user understand their activity details.

---

### Transactions And Matching

The Loopring match service (Miner) obtains unfinished orders through internal RPC interfaces, finds loops, submits Ethereum smart contracts, and eventually resolves services through Ethereum to obtain match results and update order status.

---

### Market Exchange Rates

The relay provides the market information necessary for the exchange, including in-depth/orderbook/news/ticker/trend/kline, etc., and integrates coinmarketcap global market conditions. Recently, we teamed up with MyToken to access the MyToken open platform to obtain more comprehensive market data and to provide users with comprehensive transaction reference information.

---

### Meta Information Management 

The meta-information management here includes information on the best estimated gasPrice, the contract information currently supported by the relay (Delegate and Protocol correspondence), the list of transaction pairs supported by the relay, and the Token list.

---

## How to Access the Relay

There are currently 3 ways to access the relay: jsonrpc, socketio, and sdk.

### JSONRPC

JSON-RPC is a cross-language Remote Call Protocol based on JSON. JSON-RPC is very simple. The format of the data transfer to the server requested is as follows (based on JSON2.0):
```
{
   "jsonrpc" : 2.0,
   "method" : "helloLoopring", 
   "params" : [{"key" : "value"}], 
   "id" : 347579
}
```

For specific JSON RPC interface access info, please refer to the API documentation.

---

### socketio

SocketIO encapsulates the underlying communication as an event programming model and provides event-based long connection communication. In order to improve the real-time performance of data, the relay adopts the same technical means as the traditional centralized exchange to enhance the user experience. For specific socket access methods, refer to the API documentation.

--- 

### SDK
Based on the network interface, we further encapsulated the relay interface calls to form multiple platforms of sdk, allowing developers to get access through method calls. Currently, the JavaScript version of Loopring.js is open source, and IOS and Java SDK are under development. The SDK is a development from the JSONRPC and Socketio interface calls.

---

### Test Environment

The relay currently provides a complete set of testing environments for the partners to develop and debug their Dapps. To use the relay test environment, you need to know this relevant information:
1. The test environment address is 13.112.62.24
 - the jsonrpc entry is: http://13.112.62.24/rpc/v2

## How to Deploy Your Own Relay

The Loopring Foundation implements two versions of the relay: standalone and cluster. Below is how to compile and deploy the standalone version.

---

### Compilation
Relays are developed using the golang language. Version 1.9.2 is used when developing relays. Version 1.9 is recommended for compiler relays. Go build your own environment. Please make your own google source code address: https://github.com/Loopring/relay, please use the master branch code to compile and run, and please refer to README

--- 

### Profile

The relay contains two configuration files: relay.toml and tokens.json. The first is a relay global configuration and the second is used to specify the list of Tokens supported by the relay and the market. There are many relay configuration items. Here is a description of the more important ones in relay.toml:
```
websocket      - Relay’s external socketio ports
jsonrpc        - Relay’s external jsonrpc ports
ipfs & gateway - The configuration of the message broadcast, which has been annotated, and cannot be configured by you
accessor       - Ethereum network node url, an array that can support multi-access simultaneously
extractor.start_block_number   - Which block to start processing when the relay starts, it is recommended to change to the latest block when starting the first time, reducing unnecessary block synchronization
extractor.confirm_block_number - After a certain number of blocks are confirmed, the extractor sends the transaction message for use by other modules.
common abi     - Contains ERC20 standard ABI, WETH ABI and Loopring contract ABI configuration, if it is linked to the main network, you will not be able to modify
gateway filter - Used to configure various validation rules for submitting orders
miner          - When mining in miner mode, configure mining parameters
```

We will further update the relay.toml configuration file, add comments, and do self-explanations.

---

### Distributed Relay
The distributed relay is a distributed version of the relay. Although the single node relay can fully support the wallet and the DEX service, there is a single point of failure in the architecture, the upgrade and expansion are difficult, and the performance bottleneck cannot be downgraded when system problems are encountered. In order to make relaying an enterprise-class application, and to provide high-performance wallets and DEX services, we have reconfigured the relays to split the original system into three services of relays, bindings, and parsers. This is a distributed version of microservices.

---

### github
The distributed relay includes the following github libraries: relay-cluster/miner/extractor/relay-lib, which gives a brief introduction to the role of each library:
* Relay-cluster: Relay-cluster version, providing wallet and DEX background services
* miner: cooperative services
* extractor: Ethereum analysis service
* relay-lib: Basic library for use on the above microservices system

---

### Microservice Introduction

#### relay-cluster
The relay-cluster function is basically the same as that of the previous single-node version relay function. It provides background services for wallets and DEX applications, and strips off the matching service and the Ethereum resolution service originally used in the single-node version relay. This is the function provided by the current relay-cluster.

#### miner
Match services, receive orders, find loops, submit loops to Ethereum networks, serve relay-cluster communications via rpc

#### extractor
Ethereum analyzing services. Every transaction, every event, etc. that occur on Ethereum is analyzed by the extractor and then put into events. It is provided to the relay-cluster and miner through the message queue (currently kafka).

---

## Who should deploy a distributed version
Distributed relay is a complete enterprise-level distributed application. The current system volume is relatively small and only contains 3 micro-services, but with other distributed applications, we have done the following:
* Based on aws ALB to provide a complete load-balancing strategy
* We deployed a highly available kafka&zookeeper cluster
* Adopted aws redis active and standby mode cache clusters and mysql storage cluster
* Has 200+ perfect cloudwatch monitoring configuration items
* Supported aws codedeploy one-click deployment script
* There is disaster recovery and fault tolerance in place for each single point where there may be failure or other problems in the system.

Therefore, if partners want to deploy a highly capable relay, they need to do a lot of system work and need very professional engineers to maintain it for a long time. Our proposal is to deploy distributed relays with partners with certain R&D strengths. Of course, we will also provide deployment assistance as much as possible.

---

### Distributed Version Docker Images
In order to facilitate the deployment of distributed relays by partners, we will provide the following docker images (in production):
* relay-cluster docker image
* Miner mirror docker image
* Extractor docker image
* zookeeper&kafka docker image
* mysql & redis, please download the official docker image yourself

Please see the setion `Work With Docker`

---

### Distributed Relay Configuration
The configuration files of each microservice and middleware need to be independent of the mirror configuration. We will update the configuration file description and increase self-explanation. This part of the work will be completed together with the dockerization and then provided to the partners for use.
